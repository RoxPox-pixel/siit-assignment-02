    <h2> Part 1 </h2>
    <p>Part 1 - random number generation, switch / if-else-if control structures <br><br>

        In your local repository, create a folder called exercise-01. Inside the folder, add  index.html & main.js files. The exercise should implement the following problem:
        
        The program will generate two random numbers between 1 and 10, and a random operation between addition + , subtraction - or multiplication *. The user is then prompted to provide the correct value of the operation. <br>
        
        Use a prompt modal dialogue box  to display the text of the challenge, and an alert modal dialogue box to display if the answer is correct. <br><br>
        
        Example 1: <br>
        Prompt message : “5 + 3 =” <br>
        User input: 8 <br>
        Alert message: “Your answer is correct!” <br><br>
        
        Example 2: <br>
        Prompt message : “2 - 9 =” <br>
        User input: -6 <br>
        Alert message: “Your answer is wrong! The correct value is -7” <br><br>
        
        Example 3: <br>
        Prompt message : “2 * 9 =” <br>
        User input: 20 <br>
        Alert message: “Your answer is wrong! The correct value is 18” <br> <br>
        
        After implementing the solution, commit the changes and push them to the public repository. Use “exercise 1”  as the name for the commit.</p>
