Part 2 - repetitive and decisional control structures, logical operators
In your local repository, create a folder called exercise-02. Inside the folder, add index.html & main.js files. The exercise should implement the following problem:

Using an iteration, allow the user to input 5 numbers (the user will provide valid numbers). Display the maximum value.

Example: 
Input value 1: 5
Input value 2: -4
Input value 3: 7
Input value 4: 0
Input value 5: -2
Output message: “The maximum value is 7”

After implementing the solution, commit the changes and push them to the public repository. Use “adds exercise 2”  as the name for the commit.

HINT: The solution can be implemented either by using arrays or not. Any implementation is considered correct.
