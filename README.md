Part 1 - random number generation, switch / if-else-if control structures
In your local repository, create a folder called exercise-01. Inside the folder, add  index.html & main.js files. The exercise should implement the following problem:

The program will generate two random numbers between 1 and 10, and a random operation between addition + , subtraction - or multiplication *. The user is then prompted to provide the correct value of the operation.

Use a prompt modal dialogue box  to display the text of the challenge, and an alert modal dialogue box to display if the answer is correct.

Example 1: 
Prompt message : “5 + 3 =”
User input: 8
Alert message: “Your answer is correct!”

Example 2: 
Prompt message : “2 - 9 =”
User input: -6
Alert message: “Your answer is wrong! The correct value is -7”

Example 3: 
Prompt message : “2 * 9 =”
User input: 20
Alert message: “Your answer is wrong! The correct value is 18”

After implementing the solution, commit the changes and push them to the public repository. Use “exercise 1”  as the name for the commit.
