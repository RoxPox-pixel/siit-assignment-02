Part 3 - Arrays, iterations, switch/if-else-if
In your local repository, create a folder called exercise-03. Inside the folder, add index.html & main.js files. The exercise should implement the following problem:

The user provides any number of values for your program which you must store them in an array. Iterate through the array and count the number of elements that have the remainder of division by 3 equal to 0, 1 and 2 

Example: 
Prompt “How many values will you provide”: 
User input: 5

Prompt “Input value 1”
User input: 25

Prompt “Input value 2”
User input: 30

Prompt “Input value 3”
User input: 9

Prompt “Input value 4”
User input: 10

Prompt “Input value 5”
User input: 15

Output message:“3 numbers that you provided have the remainder of division by 3 equal to 0”

Output message: “2 numbers that you provided have the remainder of division by 3 equal to 1”

Output message: “0 numbers that you provided have the remainder of division by 3 equal to 2”

After implementing the solution, commit the changes and push them to the public repository. Use “adds exercise 3”  as the name for the commit.

WARNING: even if this exercise can be solved without using an array, it is mandatory to use an array in order to check that the concepts are fully understood!
